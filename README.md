# EntitiesVapor

## Introduction
This repository serves as a platform for my exploration and learning journey in backend development using Swift's native environment, specifically through the Vapor framework. The primary focus is on understanding databases and backend services, thereby enhancing my skills beyond the visual layer commonly associated with mobile development.

## Project Inspiration
The inception of this project stems from a desire to broaden my expertise in mobile application development, particularly in the realm of business logic and backend systems. Inspired by the innovative approach of Matheus Migge's [Pra Quem eu Rezo](https://github.com/matheusmigge/pra-quem-eu-rezo) solution, I embarked on this challenge to delve deeper into the intricacies of backend development.

## About the Project
This repository is a reflection of my commitment to advancing my knowledge and skills in backend development within the Swift ecosystem. While primarily an educational endeavor, the project aims to evolve into a robust database service that complements Matheus Migge's application.
